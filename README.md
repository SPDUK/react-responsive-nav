# react-responsive-nav
If you're wondering how to use this:

See a working example on [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/tender-paper-og7p4?file=/src/App.js)

Or a [code example on GitHub](https://github.com/SPDUK/react-responsive-nav-example)

# Development

`npm install` to install dev deps

`npm link` to make a link so you can import the module for testing locally (need to rebuild after changes)

`npm build` to build and update the deployed module

Create a new example app with create-react-app, then run `npm link react-responsive-nav`, from there you can import it and use it like any other module `import { Navbar } from "react-responsive-nav"`.

Run `npm run start` to begin watching changes during development, then in the secondary project (created with CRA) you can also run `npm run start` there, when you make changes you'll have hot reloading for both.
