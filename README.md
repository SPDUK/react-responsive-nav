# react-responsive-nav


# Development

`npm install` to install dev deps

`npm link` to make a link so you can import the module for testing locally (need to rebuild after changes)

`npm build` to build and update the deployed module


Create a new example app with create-react-app, then run `npm link react-responsive-nav`, from there you can import it and use it like any other module `import ReactResponsiveNav from "react-responsive-nav"`.
